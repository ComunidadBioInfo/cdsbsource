[Leonardo](http://lcolladotor.github.io/) uses `R` daily and contributes [R packages](https://lcolladotor.github.io/pkgs/) to the [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/) project as part of his work at [LIBD](https://www.libd.org/). He is interested in high-throughput genomics assays such as RNA-seq, developments in R and helping others get started in their R journey. Leonardo has been learning and teaching R since 2008 and is a co-founder of the [LIBD rstats club](http://research.libd.org/rstatsclub/#.XKVLJetKi50).
