During my PhD project, in the [Computational Genomics Laboratory](https://biocomputo2.ibt.unam.mx) at IBT-UNAM, I focused on the study of bacterial transcriptional regulators through evolution. Additionally, I gained experience in writing R/Bioconductor packages and teaching R.

Currently, I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Personalized Medicine of the [Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai](https://icahn.mssm.edu), in New York City. My main interest is bioinformatics and the development of open source software for the analysis of single cell and spatial transcriptomics.

Besides my research project, I enjoy teaching R and participating in activities that help expand the community of software developers in Latin America.
