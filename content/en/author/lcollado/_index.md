[Leonardo](http://lcolladotor.github.io/) uses `R` daily and contributes packages to the Bioconductor project as part of his work with [Andrew Jaffe](http://aejaffe.com/) at [LIBD](https://www.libd.org/). He is interested in high-throughput genomics assays such as RNA-seq, developments in R and helping others get started in their R journey. Leonardo has been learning and teaching R since 2008 and is a co-founder of the [LIBD rstats club](http://research.libd.org/rstatsclub/#.XKVLJetKi50).
